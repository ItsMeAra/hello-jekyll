# Hello Jekyll

Hello Jekyll is an unstyled and somewhat opinionated [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) boilerplate that utilizes [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) as the CSS preprocessor and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) as the task runner. 


## Usage

After cloning this repo, follow these steps:

#### 1. Install Jekyll with `gem install jekyll`.
#### 2. Install project dependencies with `npm install`.
#### 3. Run Grunt with `grunt`.
#### 4. Get to work! :)

#### For a production ready build, run `grunt prod`.
