# Hello Jekyll

Hello Jekyll is an un-styled and somewhat opinionated [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) boilerplate that utilizes [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) as the CSS preprocessor and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) as the task runner. 


## Usage

After cloning this repo, follow these steps:

1. Install Jekyll (if you dont have it) with `gem install jekyll`
2. Install project dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run Grunt with `grunt`
4. Get to work! 


For a production ready build, run `grunt prod`.


## Notes
- Make sure to update the `CNAME` file with your URL.
- Configuration options can be found in the `_config.yml` file.
